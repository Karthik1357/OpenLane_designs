# OpenLane_designs

This repository contains the code for designing and testing digital integrated circuits using the OpenLANE flow, Google Colab, and Python scripts. OpenLANE is an open-source digital RTL to GDSII flow for VLSI design. With the integration of Google Colab, you can leverage cloud-based resources to run complex VLSI design tasks without the need for powerful local hardware.
